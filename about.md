They say the best way to learn something is to try to explain it to someone else
assuming that they have no previous knowledge about the subject.
That was the main driver almost two years ago for me to start writing this
blog.
Although I haven't had as much time as I would have wished to write, I can now
say with confidence that the statement of the previous paragraph is completely
true, at least for me.

A side effect of writing to understand things better is that I usually use my
own blog as a quick remainder of things that I once knew but that are now gone
from my long term memory.
Hopefully, in the process of reaching these two goals, I can also help other
people who are working on the same subjects.
