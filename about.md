This blog will contain random posts on software development best practices, methodologies and patterns, 
particularly those oriented towards the JVM platform.

A little bit about me: 

Professional software developer and scientist. Naturally curious and critical thinker. 
Always looking for new challenges: “If you’re the smartest person in the room, then you are in the wrong room”.
