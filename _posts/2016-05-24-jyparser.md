If you've ever had to parse JSON from your terminal you probably know about
[jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/). It's basically `sed` for JSON and it works
wonderfully well.
If you've had to parse YAML from your terminal however, the problem becomes a
bit harder. You can either go for some super obscure [15 lines sed and awk
combination](http://stackoverflow.com/a/21189044) that has the advantage of
being pure bash, or go with a higher level language (ruby or python comes to
mind) to actually do the parsing and outputting the result to stdout.
In this post I'll show [jyparser](https://github.com/jlordiales/jyparser), a
simple tool (packaged as a nice docker image) that allows you to use a jq-like
syntax to parse and also update JSON and YAML files from your terminal using
exactly the same commands.

# The problem
So imagine you have your app and different JSON files for the different
environments your app will be deployed to, with each file containing things like
the environment name, the build version currently deployed, etc.
Maybe something like:

{% highlight bash %}
~ cat my_app.json

{
  "app_name" : "awesome app",
  "build_version" : 1,
  "tags" : ["myTeam", "myCompany"]
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now as part of your deployment process you want to read the `build_version`
variable from the JSON file, increase it by 1 and then update the original JSON
with the new value.

This would not be super hard to do with plain `jq`:

{% highlight bash %}
~ version=$(cat my_app.json | jq '.build_version')
~ echo $version
1

~ new_version=$((version+1))
~ echo $new_version
2

~ cat my_app.json | jq --arg value $new_version '.build_version |= $value'
{
  "app_name": "awesome app",
  "build_version": "2",
  "tags": [
    "myTeam",
    "myCompany"
  ]
}
{% endhighlight %}

It's not too hard but it's not straightforward either, specially the update
part. You have to know about `jq` update operator (`|=`) and how you can pass
env variables using `--arg`.

Now imagine you decide to switch to YAML instead of JSON because either you
started using a different tool that only accepts YAML or the same tool accepts
both and you prefer it over JSON.

{% highlight bash %}
~ cat my_app.yml

app_name: awesome app
build_version: 1
tags:
- myTeam
- myCompany
{% endhighlight %}

You still want to accomplish the same thing, bump the `build_version` of your
YAML. But your previous deployment bash script with your fancy `jq` query
obviously doesn't work anymore.
Now you need to figure out how you're going to parse and update that YAML, which
like I mentioned in the beginning is not trivial (or at least I didn't find a
nice and easy way to do it).

Wouldn't it be nice if you could somehow say: `cat my_app.{yml, json} | get
.build_version` to read the value you are interested in and `cat my_app.{yml,
json} | set .build_version <new_value>` to update it? 
That is, use exactly the same command regardless of where the input is coming
from (JSON or YAML). Enter `jyparser`

# jyparser
jyparser stands for JSON/YAML Parser (I know, not very original but I always
sucked at names) and it was created specifically for the use
case I described above. Getting a single value from a JSON or YAML, doing
something with it (if needed) and then setting a new value for it on the
original input. Of course reading/updating entire objects/arrays in JSON or
entire hashes/lists in YAML is also supported.

At its hearth jyparser is a simple wrapper around `jq` and 2 python 1 liners to
convert from JSON to YAML and vice versa. It will detect the input's type and,
in the case of YAML, convert to JSON before applying `jq` and then convert the
result back to YAML.
Note that since YAML is actually a [superset of
JSON](http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2759572) this will only work for
those YAML files that can be correctly converted to JSON.

You can see the code [here](https://github.com/jlordiales/jyparser) and the
docker image [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/jlordiales/jyparser/).

## Usage
Let's look at some examples of how you would usually use the tool.

The image's entry point accepts 2 operations: `get` and `set`. It can
take its inputs from stdin or read from a file if this is passed as the first
parameter. 

### Read
The `get` command takes an arbitrary `jq` filter. If the result is a simple
value (number, string or boolean) then that value is returned. Otherwise, the
resulting JSON or YAML is returned (depending on what the input was).

Given the following JSON file:

{% highlight bash %}
~ cat test.json

{"menu": {
  "id": "file",
  "value": "File",
  "popup": {
    "menuitem": [
      {"value": "New", "onclick": "CreateNewDoc()"},
      {"value": "Open", "onclick": "OpenDoc()"},
      {"value": "Close", "onclick": "CloseDoc()"}
    ]
  }
}}
{% endhighlight %}

If you wanted to get the value of the _id_ property you could use:

{% highlight bash %}
~ cat test.json | docker run -i --rm jlordiales/jyparser get .menu.id

"file"
{% endhighlight %}

The JSON is passed via stdin, which is useful if you get that from something like
`curl`. If you have an actual file that you want to use as input then you can
pass it directly as the first parameter to the script:

{% highlight bash %}
~ docker run -i --rm -v `pwd`:/jyparser:ro jlordiales/jyparser test.json get ".menu.id"

"file"
{% endhighlight %}

The example above mounts the current dir with the file into `/jyparser` (which
is the default WORKDIR for the docker image) and then uses that file as input.

Exactly the same command works for YAML as well. Given the equivalent YAML file:

{% highlight bash %}
~ cat test.yml
menu:
  id: file
  value: File
  popup:
    menuitem:
    - onclick: CreateNewDoc()
      value: New
    - onclick: OpenDoc()
      value: Open
    - onclick: CloseDoc()
      value: Close
{% endhighlight %}

We can get the `id` property with:

{% highlight bash %}
~ cat test.yml | docker run -i --rm jlordiales/jyparser get .menu.id

"file"
{% endhighlight %}

If the result from running the `jq` filter is not a simple value, then the
corresponding JSON or YAML is returned:

{% highlight bash %}
~ cat test.json | docker run -i --rm jlordiales/jyparser get ".menu.popup.menuitem[1]"

{
  "value": "Open",
  "onclick": "OpenDoc()"
}

~ cat test.yml | docker run -i --rm jlordiales/jyparser get ".menu.popup.menuitem[1]"

onclick: OpenDoc()
value: Open
{% endhighlight %}

The `jq` filter that is passed as parameter is sent as is to the tool, so you
are not limited so simple filters. Anything that is valid for `jq` is valid for
`jyparser` as well.

### Update
Similarly to the `get` operation, there's a `set` one. This operation takes 2
parameters: a `jq` filter to select a specific element of the input and a new
value to update that element to. The result is the original input with the value
updated.

{% highlight bash %}
~ cat test.json | docker run -i --rm jlordiales/jyparser set ".menu.id" \"new_id\"
{
  "menu": {
    "id": "new_id",
    "value": "File",
    "popup": {
      "menuitem": [
        {
          "value": "New",
          "onclick": "CreateNewDoc()"
        },
        {
          "value": "Open",
          "onclick": "OpenDoc()"
        },
        {
          "value": "Close",
          "onclick": "CloseDoc()"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

**Important**: given the way bash scripts handle quotes on parameters passed to
them, if the new value you want to set for the property is a string you need to
explicitly escape the quotes as in the example. Otherwise, `jq` will complain
that the value is not valid (rightfully so). This is not needed for numbers or
booleans.
So the following works as expected:

{% highlight bash %}
~ cat test.json | docker run -i --rm jlordiales/jyparser set ".menu.id" 15
{
  "menu": {
    "id": 15,
    "value": "File",
    "popup": {
      "menuitem": [
        {
          "value": "New",
          "onclick": "CreateNewDoc()"
        },
        {
          "value": "Open",
          "onclick": "OpenDoc()"
        },
        {
          "value": "Close",
          "onclick": "CloseDoc()"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

This way of updating the JSON is arguably a lot easier to read and use than the
`jq` version we saw at the beginning. It's just `set <key> <value>` and, best of
all, the same works for YAML:

{% highlight bash %}
~ cat test.yml | docker run -i --rm jlordiales/jyparser set ".menu.id" \"new_id\"

menu:
  id: new_id
  popup:
    menuitem:
    - onclick: CreateNewDoc()
      value: New
    - onclick: OpenDoc()
      value: Open
    - onclick: CloseDoc()
      value: Close
  value: File
{% endhighlight %}

As with the get operation, set can take the input both from stdin and a file if
passed as first argument.

# Conclusion
If you are doing regular parsing/updating of JSON and/or YAML and you don't want
to have hugely complex combinations of `jq` with `sed` and `awk` but instead
have a simple interface to work with both types then give jyparser a try. 
It was created for a very specific use case but it might be able to adapt to
yours as well.

jyparser was heavily inspired by [y2j](https://github.com/wildducktheories/y2j),
so make sure to check it out as well.
